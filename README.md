The solution to this lab has been implemented in C++.

Please follow the steps given below to run the code:

1. Unzip the zip file.

2. We have to load a module before executing.
```
module load gcc-9.2
```
3. Running the Makefile
```
make
```
4. To run any input (for example, in4 on the WORKING SET scheduler with number of frames 16):
```
./mmu -f16 -aw -oOFPS inputs/in4 inputs/rfile
```
